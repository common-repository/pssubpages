Shows the child pages of the current page. Configurable title, show siblings (or not), and "no child" text

== Description ==

This plugin provides a "Sub Page" widget. It lists all of the pages which are children of the current page. If there are no children, it will not display.

Options include:

* title (obviously)
* "No Sub-pages" text instead of blank (configurable)
* hide widget when no sub-pages
* show siblings when no sub-pages

While this is a small widget, I have attempted to make this as configurable as possible, with clean and efficient code (this is a small widget, and shouldn't slow your site down).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `psSubPages.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Add the widget to your sidebar through the `Appearance -> Widgets` menu in WordPress

or

1. Unzip the folder
1. Upload to `wp-content/plugins/`
